# Turn on the live HTTPS site (one-time)

Your quiz will be hosted at this **HTTPS** URL (same as running it locally, but on GitHub):

**https://jaydenmedifocal.github.io/UEEEL0012-Install-low-voltage-wiring-appliances-switchgear-and-associated-accessories/**

## Enable it

1. Open your repo:  
   **https://github.com/jaydenmedifocal/UEEEL0012-Install-low-voltage-wiring-appliances-switchgear-and-associated-accessories**

2. Click **Settings** (repo menu, not your profile).

3. In the left sidebar, click **Pages** (under "Code and automation").

4. Under **Build and deployment**:
   - **Source:** choose **Deploy from a branch**
   - **Branch:** choose **main**
   - **Folder:** choose **/ (root)**
   - Click **Save**

5. Wait 1–2 minutes. GitHub will build and deploy. You’ll see a green box like:  
   *"Your site is live at https://jaydenmedifocal.github.io/..."*

6. Open the link above (or the one in the green box). The exam runs in the browser over HTTPS—no need to run anything locally.

That’s it. Anyone with the link can do the exam.
